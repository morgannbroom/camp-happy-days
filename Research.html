						<h1>Research</h1>

					<h2>Interviews</h2>
<h3>Client</h3>
					<p>For my client interview I spoke with Emily Juszczyk who is the Camp & Programs Manager of Camp Happy Days. She is also directly over the social media and website of the organization. She was very helpful and talked to me for as long as I needed.</p>
					<p>From the Interview with Emj, I learned that she also felt like there was a lot of copy on their site. She felt that things could be better organized or condensed, just as I had been feeling. This was fantastic hearing her say it without me having to bring it up at all. She also felt like a lot of the programs they offer aren’t being highlighted enough or are overshadowed. These comments and thoughts will help me figure out the best way to condense the information and highlight what’s truly important.</p>
			<!--	<ol>
<li>What is the primary goal of your website? Secondary and Tertiary?
<p>People to gain awareness and info about programs and what you all do</p></li>
<li>Who is your primary target audience?
<p>Families dealing with cancer that are either already in the system or hearing about it for the first time</p></li>
<li>How do you feel the site is successful? How is it unsuccessful?
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to show off the camp that they offer</li>
<li>Not highlighting enough of their other programs</li>
<li>A lot of information</li>
<li>Does a good job promoting camp through photos and videos</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ol> -->
					<h3>User</h3>
				<p>I interviewed Ryan Rogers, a 20 year old childhood friend of a kid who went to Camp Happy Days as my user. He is a potential person that would like to use Camp Happy Day's website to sign up and volunteer.</p>
				<p>Ryan knows about this organization by word of mouth, which is what Emj said is the main way people hear about it. He didn’t need a whole explanation about camp and volunteering in order to sign up. He had to scroll a lot and figure out which button was the right one in order to begin the application process. This could cause potential volunteers to click off the site and not sign up at all. </p>

							<!--<p>For my interviews I managed to get in touch, via email, with the education director at GCCH. His name is Mark Mussman and he was nice enough to answer my questions fully and honestly. I also interviewed my significant other because he was the reason I chose this website. His perspective as a user struggling to navigate the site is valuable.</p>
					<h3>GCCH Interview</h3>
					<p><a href="images/GCHC-26.jpg">This screen shot</a> is the full interview with Dr. Mussman, the education director at GCCH. This interview was insightful because it helped me realize that they do not offer volunteer opportunities; they instead take interns or they can connect volunteers with one of their member organizations. That means my audiences and their goals will be slightly different. I also realized from this interview that they in fact do rely on donations from their site. Lastly, this interview shed some light on things they are looking for in a redesign that I had not considered such as a well organized mobile version of the site, a timeline of the coalition's history, and that their paper needs a place to share their past editions. Dr. Mussman was the education director so he could have been biased but he did make it out that education is a big goal of the coalition.</p>
					<h3>User Interview</h3>
					<p>I interviewed John Roth, a sociology major at University of Cincinnati and an Ohio resident.</p>
					<p>	So, the user interview shed some light on the way some people might be approaching the GCCH website. John was looking for volunteering opportunities but did not find it because they do not offer any. So, the content in my design will explain in some way that the coalition can connect people with volunteer opportunities with their member organizations. Perhaps a tab that reads volunteering but once you get there it explains how they do not offer volunteering but they can connect you to their member organizations. I think that not having the tab, like John expressed in his interview, would cause confusion because many people first assume that a non-profit needs volunteers. Also if one of their primary audience members is students then these demographics will be looking for things like volunteering.</p>
					<p>I also overall know from John's confusion that the site needs a clearer design so that when a person visits they know what this organization does, why they are necessary, and what the user can do to contribute. It would be wasteful for users to come to the site with expectations and then leave it because a) they cannot find the answer to their purpose of visiting, or b) they don't know what the Coalition actually is.</p>
