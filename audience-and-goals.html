						<h1>Determine Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>Once we researched our organization, we dug deeper to find out who exacty our audience is and what their goals may be.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>Through categorization and organization of our target audiences, we found out who was the direct audience and the indirect audience.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
			<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/AUDIENCE.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<section>
				<div class="8u$"><p>My first audience group are the people directly involved with the organization or affected by it. This includes the children with cancer as well as their parents and siblings, potential volunteers, and kids/teens who have beat cancer.</p></div>
						<!--<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-14.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>-->
						<div class="8u$"><p>The next audience group are the people associated with the organization or peripherally relevant to the topic or cause. This includes, friends and distant relatives of the kids batteling cancer, former campers wanting to come back and volunteer, and average-high income adults that want to donate.</p></div>
					<!--	<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-15.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>-->
						<div class="8u$"><p>Lastly, the third and final audience are groups of people the organization wants on their side, or it's fans. This audience includes the children's hospitals, nurses and public schools as well as people in the community who have been directly affected by cancer either through a family member, a friend or themselves.</p></div>

					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>After a lot of brain dumps and lengthy thought I narrowed down the site's goals to three main areas: camper sign ups, volunteer sign ups, and donations. Of course there's other goals such as getting users familiar with the organization, promoting other programs, and advertising fundraisers and events, but those aren't the main focus of the website. My challenge is to effectively create a site that highlights each of these goals without overwhelming the users.</p>

					<p>These goals mainly stemmed from my interview with Emj as her and I were discussing what the main goals of the organization were. I think it's important to promote the camp as much as possible so that as many kids and families get the chance to experience the camp. I also know how valuable and needed volunteers and donations are, which is why I have decided to make these my secondary and tertiary goals. In my interview, Emj mentioned that the main way people find out about the camp is through word of mouth. People aren't exactly visitng the site to find out information about the camp, they're going there to sign up. Once families know about the camp and sign their kids up, they tell family and friends about it who, then, are going to the webiste to find out how they can help in any way. This is all why the three main goals are sign ups for camp and volunteer work as well as donations.</p>
