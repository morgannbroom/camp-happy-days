						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>First, we started with determining the design challenge. This is a worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit helps frame the challenge as an actionable question.</p>
					</header>
					<h3><strong>What is the problem you’re trying to solve?</strong></h3>
<p>Provide cost free camps and events to children who have battled and/or are continuing to battle cancer
Frame the design question:
<h3><strong>How can Camp Happy days get more campers, volunteers, and donations through their website?
State the impact you’re trying to have?</strong></h3>
<p>I want there to be an increase in sign-ups for the camp, for both campers and volunteers as well as an increase in donations given to the organization.</p>

<h3><strong>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</strong></h3>
<p>Condensing information within tabs (taking away or combining some tabs), making specific goals evident on the homepage, creating a more user-friendly design that shortens their time trying to find important information, minimizing distracting design elements (unnecessary colors, script type, excess photography).</p>

<h3><strong>What are some of the context and constraints that you’re facing?</strong></h3>
<p>This is a small camp, based only in Charleston. They don’t do much advertising and have very little branding. May be difficult to access photography and or video material.</p>

<h3><strong>Does your original question need a tweak?</strong></h3>
<p>How can the Camp Happy Days website easily provide information about the camp, volunteering, and donating to the families/friends of children dealing with cancer?</p>
