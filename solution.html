						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>For the final solution we created style tiles and mocked up our call to actions in order to showcase what the future website could potentially look like.</p>

					<h2>Call to action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/finalcalltoaction-08 2.jpg" alt="CTA" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>For my call to action I decided to come up with a banner that draws users in and motivates them to click the button, which reads: "Sign Up." I wanted "Sign Up" to be the main CTA because of the interview I conducted with Emj as well as the audience and goals activity. These two steps in the ideation process helped me realize that the primary goal of Camp Happy Days is to have kids and families attend their camps and events.</p>
							<p>The interview and ideation activities also helped me pin-point a secondary and tertiary goal and CTA as well. The organization needs more volunteers and donations to continue to provide for the families that sign up. I decided to add the donate button at the top right in bright yellow to grab users attention and single out the action I want users to take. I also added a volunteer section in the crossbar indicating that this is where any and all volunteers should click in order to sign up. This is a feature that is already on their website, but the idea is that it's easier to find and there's less information following the click. </p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>The style tile needed to incorporate the main elements of the site design such as imagery, type, color and CTA buttons to communicate the tone and appearance of the website.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>In my style tile I updated the current Camp Happy Days logo with a fresh, friendly and representative mark. I also desaturated the primary color palette the original site uses while staying true to the youthful and childlike feel that Camp Happy Days wishes to convey. The type is strong, yet inviting and youthful. Overall, the aesthetic is meant to reflect the three main adjectives that Emj and I talked about during our interview: hopeful, inspiring and lively.
						</p><p>
							I use blue to keep a calm and neutral feel throughout the site while incorporating the playful pops of yellow and strong, eye-catching red in order to grab users attention. I also added a good amount of imagery to show off the camp and all it has to offer. The images go along with the adjectives as well as set an overall tone and feel for the website.
						</p><p>
							 The main goals of the site are to get people to sign up for camp, either as campers or counselors, and to get people to donate to the organization. The hope is that the reds and yellows draw users eyes to the CTA buttons and easily allow users to do the action they're being asked to do.
